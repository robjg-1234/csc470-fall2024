## The Griddler

Upon opening your eyes, you come to the realization that you are situated within a cave where only a single panel is visible; the responsibility of locating a suitable place to rest now falls upon you.

This is a first-person puzzle game where you will encounter different grid puzzles that have types of cells that will affect the way you solve the grid. All the puzzles can be continued after being started and allow you to come back to them in case you don't understand to enable the player to explore and learn at their own pace. There are five major sections that can be completed in any order and offer a different mechanic alongside some puzzles that combine them.

The game has minimalist visuals and focuses on helping the player focus on the puzzles instead of the environment.
